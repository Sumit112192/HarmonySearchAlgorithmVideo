# HarmonySearchAlgorithmVideo
The entire video will be divided into three parts or simply three chapters

# Chapter 1
This chapter will contain the intro to HS where it will be related to the musician method of finding the best (optimized) pitch.

# Chapter 2
This chapter will explain the HS algorithm pseudocode, one example ( minima of a two variable function )

Pseudo-code:
 
Step 1. Initialize the optimization problem and algorithm parameters.

Step 2. Initialize the harmony memory (HM).

Step 3. Improvise a new harmony from the HM.

Step 4. Update the HM.

Step 5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the termination criterion is satisfied.



# Chapter 3
Finally, in  chapter 3, we'll be showing other applications of HS algorithm.
